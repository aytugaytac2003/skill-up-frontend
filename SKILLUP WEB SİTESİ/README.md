# Skill-Up

Skill-Up is a small productivity-focused web project developed as part of the
"Productive Artificial Intelligence" course.

The main purpose of this project is to practice building a clean and structured
frontend application using vanilla web technologies, while focusing on clarity,
usability, and basic project organization.

This repository represents a learning-oriented project rather than a production
application.
